		<h2>Challenges</h>
			<p>Starting this lab, We had to rewatch the lecture to capture exactly what Wes was trying to teach us. A challenge for us
				has been the links on the page: the ones on our index and the one in javascript. Our main conflicts were with javascript especially source output
				and trying to get it to work with inspect on our 'view in browser' portion of the lab. We had several people look it over and while our coding was
				right, it wasn't coming up in our browser which was incredibly confusing for us.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h>
				<p> Where we landed, we had a good portion figured out, but there are minor parts that we missed. We were unable to connect our JS to our index.html. We consulted with others in class and they were unable to spot what we must've missed. When we worked with the console on our page, we got most of the components, except for the "age" portion of it. A border bled over into our page. We had an image that appeared. We ended up with an errant "Script Output" heading where the JS was supposed to show up.</p>
