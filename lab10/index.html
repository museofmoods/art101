			<h1>Lab 10 - Functions</h1>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				One of the challenges that my partner and I had was that we were both in two different locations this week. We usually use our time in section and outside time in the study room to work on our labs. Unfortunately, because of an unforeseen personal emergency, we had trouble connecting this week as well as we normally do.
