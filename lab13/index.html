			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<div id="content">

				<p>One of the challenges that my partner and I had was that we were both in two different locations this week. We usually use our time in section and outside time in the study room to work on our labs. Unfortunately, because of an unforeseen personal emergency, we had trouble connecting this week as well as we normally do.</p>

</div>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Formatting our CSS</li>
			<li>Feeling like the work was completed correctly</li>
			<li>Making it look like a real website</li>
			<li>Communicating the issues we were having</li>
			<li>Feeling confident with what we had to submit</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<div id="callout">
			<p> Our website looks very bland. HOWEVER We were able to get our button on the site, which is a lot more than we expected. We're not totally certain if our page is storing the data. We used some of the code that was provided to us. We did get the headings, and are able to format our paragraphs correctly. We even have an Unordered list! Eh? I know right, it's amazing. We plan or resubmitting this lab, but for now this is what we have.
