				<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p> Our major challenge we had was interpreting our console and being able to use it properly and test our site with it. There were several components that we struggled with, namely getting our JavaScript together and working the arrays and functions. We worked named the variable "myArray" and gave it a series of numbers, closed within square brackets.  </p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>This was our problem, when we tried to declare a function, we kept getting error messages. After naming a variable, when we tested it, we got things like '$' with our answers. It didn't end up functioning the way that it was supposed nor looking the way it was supposed to, because the work we did with our CSS wasn't working like it needed to. </p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> Our resulting page was formatted correctly with the headers. Our code included all the factors that was asked of us, but there were minor mistakes that we're in the process of correcting in order to get our JavaScript and CSS functioning correctly. We're going to review older lectures to work on our comprehension of the console portion, declaring array and functions. As of now, our page is looking very basic and we're not able to test what we need to. </p>
