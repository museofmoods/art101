			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div id="content">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p> We had a few challenges with this project, namely our struggle with JavaScript and our inability to link it to our index.html. We workshopped it in section, conferring with our classmate, Aaron, but when we pored over our work, it was still unclear as to what the issue was. Jaq is having an issue with Google Chrome. The app isn't working properly, so they are alternating between browser apps.  </p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<div id="callout">
				<ul>

					<li>JavaScript and CSS connection</li>
					<li>Google Chrome functionality</li>
					<li>Trouble interpreting the Inspect features</li>
					<li>Script Output didn't appear on our page</li>
				</ul>
				<p> Some of the problems we've had in this lab was the script output. For us, we reallly struggled
					with this a lot. We also struggled with the css which is a first. </p>



			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Our work yielded an unfinished project. The only successful part of the page was that our headings and paragraphs showed up, which is a big difference from some of our previous work together. </p>

			<h2>Script Output</h2>
