			<p> My name is Jaq. I am a re-entry student to UCSC, so, while I have spent some time here in Santa Cruz, I still feel very brand new. Most of my life I have been a theatre-maker, drawing inspiration from the world around as well as my own personal story. I am currently taking time to discover what drives me and what paths my academic journey will lead me to. I am a poet and poetry has given me a really honest way for me to express myself. I like to play a lot of single-player story based video games, I spend a lot of time endlessly scrolling, and I really value the time I get to spend with the people I love. Even if it's virtual. </p>
