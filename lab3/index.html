	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>In this assignment, we worked on two different pages: The intro page in the main art101 index, and this page for Lab 3. We wanted to make sure that we understood each part of the assignment, as we've struggled in this class. Since this is a new skill, we are dealing with a lot of uncertainty. It is always uncomfortable being new to something. There is a lack of confidence and security. We're rookies. For our intro page, we wrestled with our border and the pictures. We originally started off with a border and the pictures at the same time, but, at some point, we must've forgotten some element in the process of editing, because when we went back to the page, one thing or the other was missing. </p>

			<p> My name is Jaq. I am a re-entry student to UCSC, so, while I have spent some time here in Santa Cruz, I still feel very brand new. Most of my life I have been a theatre-maker, drawing inspiration from the world around as well as my own personal story. I am currently taking time to discover what drives me and what paths my academic journey will lead me to. I am a poet and poetry has given me a really honest way for me to express myself. I like to play a lot of single-player story based video games, I spend a lot of time endlessly scrolling, and I really value the time I get to spend with the people I love. Even if it's virtual. </p>
