			<p> My name is Jaq. I am a re-entry student to UCSC, so while I have spent some time here in Santa Cruz, I still feel very brand new. I have spent much of my life as a theatre-maker, drawing inspiration from the world around as well as my own personal story. I am currently taking time to discover what drives me and what paths my academic journey will lead me. I am a poet and I really love to my express myself artistically. I like to play video games, I spend a lot of time endlessly scrolling, and I really value the time I get to spend with the people I love. Even if it's virtual! </p>
